My mother has a saying for things like this. She'd say, "Don't be stupid.", as she playfully slaps my knee. Granted, I haven't always followed her advice, but her voice still resounds in my ears in a wonderful way. I imagine that many individuals we're grown in a similar way, though, unfortunately, the opposite is likely true. Especially in the position of learning and growing, we should consistently "chew the cud". Meaning, we should consider our actions and how they affect others.

In Eric Raymond's eloquently detailed article, "How To Ask Questions The Smart Way", we come to fully understand that a "smart question" is indicative of a few things. Due diligence prior to the question being asked, consideration regarding the medium where the question is asked, and a well thought out, concise, and grammatically proper question. A smart question is more than just a prompt seeking a response or an answer to a problem. A smart question can easily display experience, preparation, tact, direction, and guidance, among many other things.

14 years and 5 months ago, Mark Rogers asked the question, "What does 'use strict' do in JavaScript, and what is the reasoning behind it?". Following his question, Mark gave a personal example that included which IDE he was using and the exact error he was receiving. Directly after that, he briefly mentions his due diligence and his interpretation of the issue. Then, he ends with his original question with additional thoughts surrounding the topic for further discussion. Although the question seems simple, the meaning behind it is meaningful and presented in a concise and useful way.

Within the day, Hai Hoang asked, "I have 4 tables but when I link 4 tables in 1 index file, when creating the table, none of the tables are linked together, please help me", followed up by poorly formatted links to his code along with the words, "I hope you will help me". In contrast to Mark's question, Hai's grammar is improper, he provides no specificity or personal insight on the efforts he has made resolve his problem, ultimately giving little reason for anyone to want to help him. This is near extreme example of a not-smart question. With some effort and possibly a few english lessons, a smart question is not too far away.
