JavaScript is fantastic! I have some previous experience in using JavaScript, when I attended a coding bootcamp for Full-Stack Development. JavaScript is the first coding language that I've learned, so when taking ICS 111, 211, and 212, I realized how intuitive the language can be. Java in ICS 111 was easy to pick up, but grasping the concept of pointer in C and C++ was definitely a tough task. I still need to practice and study them now for ICS 311 Algorithms. It's been over two years since I last used JavaScript, so this module was a great refresher. I also didn't understand the difference between ES5 and ES6, so learning what aspects were new was interesting to me to think about from a software engineering perspective. I think JavaScript is a great programming language and appreciate how powerful the dynamic ability of it is.

At first, the idea of athletic software engineering was a bit intimidating, but fortunately I am a competitive person. So, after doing our first practice WOD in class, I am even more motivated to practice and excited for future WODs. I think this style of learning is definitely stressful, especially if you haven't spent enough time coding or enough time with JavaScript, but I believe it's a valuable way to push the information into your brain in a less than conventional way. I think this method of teaching will work very well for me.
