From 2010-2013, I created and owned a retail lights and event production company with the support of my friends. The name of the company was Rave Rock and focused on EDM acts with specialtly "gloving" light sales. At the peak of the business, we were producing two events a month either with a name brand artist or themed with local talent, typically at local night clubs including Nocturna, Vice, Ginza, SoHo, The Upstairs, Artistry, and Aloha Tower. Of the acts that we contracted, music artists with up to 1.7m followers, Aly and Fila, Shogun, Heatbeat, Crankdat, Chris Schweizer, Hyperbits, Felix Cartal, Shibasan, Will Sparks, Virtual Riot, Markus Schulz, Drezo, Ekali, and many more. The largest event we coordinated had over 2,200 attendees at Aloha Tower featuring Aly and Fila with guest star Evelyn Lin. Other endeavors included collaborations with other promotion companies or brands and two consecutive package trips for local to attend the Electric Daisy Carnival in Las Vegas where more than 100 enthusiasts traveled together with discounted rates on travel, stay, and documentation.Rave Rock transitioned into a new company called Audiophile Entertainment, which continues to produce a diverse set of events at a homebase venue Hawaiian Brians since 2015.
