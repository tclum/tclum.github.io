From 2018-19, I managed a pop-up Hawaiian fusion Tex-Mex restaurant called Makana Ranch House located on Waialae Avenue. The restaurant mainly focused on special events, catering, and retail sales. Chef Ignacio was a hunter as well with the mission to make venison a mainstream meat source in Hawai'i by utilizing the over population of invasive Axis deer on the outer islands. 
I was able to use my extensive experience in the restaurant industry to manage back-end and front of the house operations for special occasions at the restaurant including weddings, birthdays, and wine-tastings, among other events. I often handled inventory for catering events, managed servers, and cooks. Of the catering events, the most unique were held at Bishop Museum and the Hawaii State Capitol, where I met Governor Ige.
