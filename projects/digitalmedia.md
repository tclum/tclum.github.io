I purchased my first camera, albeit disposable, when I was 11. I still have the photos. Now, many years later, I can say that I love photography enough to know that it isn't just a hobby, but something that I continue to respect and appreciate every day. As a freelance photographer, I've done commercial, event, wedding, graduation, product, model, and studio work. Of the cameras I've owned, the Nikon d800, Canon Mark II, Sony a7sII, and Nikon F(1) were the best.

I also have experience with videography. Of which, my most exceptional accomplishments came from obtaining a contract deal worth $10,000 to capture the essence of a local union for their centennial anniversary. To make this a little more relevant, I often volunteer at Kapi'olani CC with their commencement ceremony and at least one of my photos is featured on the main page of the newsletter mailer.
